					You want to send a message to multiple contacts and want an answer from each of them? Then sending emails via CC or BCC is not the best choice.
					<ul>
						<li>When sending an email with all contacts in CC, all contacts are visible to everybody. Many people will simply <b>not respond</b> as they <b>hide in the mass</b>. <b>"Not-me"</b> or <b>"Somebody-else"</b>	 syndrome. </li>
						<li>When sending an email with all contacts in BCC, each recepient receives an impersonal email. People identify such emails as <b>SPAM</b> or <b>unfriendly</b>. No salutation at all is <b>rude</b>. </li>
					</ul>
				
					Strongly solves that problem for you.
